To start, **clone this repository** to your local machine:

   nano .env
   ```
2. Add the following line to the .env file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

4. Save the file (CTRL+X, then Y, then ENTER).

## 4Ô∏è‚É£Installing Dependencies
Install all the required packages for all the codes to be able to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you're using a virtual environment, run:
```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ The Final Step - Run the Chatbot !!
